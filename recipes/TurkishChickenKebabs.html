    <h2>Description <hr></h2>
    <p>This chicken kebab recipe uses a flavorful, yogurt-based marinade. <br> I'd like to think that all the chicken coming off American grills this summer will be as tasty, juicy, and tender as these. <br> Even inexperienced grillers can produce impressive results! <br> I'm not sure how "Turkish" this is — it's loosely based on a lamb marinade I've used for a long time.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients: <hr></h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Aleppo red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, halved</li>
            <li>4 long metal skewers</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Directions: <hr></h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk yogurt, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, ketchup, red pepper flakes, salt, cumin, black pepper, paprika, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.
            </li> <br>
            <li>Place chicken thigh halves into the yogurt marinade and coat them thoroughly on all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 2 to 8 hours.</li> <br>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li> <br>
            <li>Using 2 skewers for each kebab, thread half of the chicken thighs onto each pair of skewers making a fairly thick "log" shape.</li> <br>
            <li>Place kebabs on the preheated grill. Do not try to turn them until they begin to unstick from the grill, 3 or 4 minutes. Turn kebabs and grill the other side for 3 to 4 minutes. Continue cooking and turning until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li> <br>
        </ol>
